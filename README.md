# Caml_qiskit

An OCaml wrapper for IBM Qiskit quantum computing toolkit.

```opam install qiskit```


## Example

```ocaml
open Qiskit

(* Create the circuit *)
let qc = quantum_circuit 2 2 
  |> h 0 
  |> id 1 
  |> barrier
  |> cx 0 1
  |> barrier
  |> measure 0 0
  |> measure 1 1
  |> draw;;
```

```ocaml
(* Start a simulation *)
Aer.get_backend "qasm_simulator" 
  |> execute qc 
  |> result 
  |> get_counts 
  |> Visualization.plot_histogram;
```

```ocaml
(* Run the circuit on real quantum hardware *)
let _ = IBMProvider.save_account "TOKEN" in
let j = IBMProvider.get_backend "ibmq_london" prov |> execute qc in
Tools.Monitor.job_monitor j;
j 
  |> result 
  |> get_counts 
  |> Visualization.plot_histogram;;
```

## Install

```opam install qiskit```

You also need to install these python libraries (via pip):

- matplotlib
- numpy
- qiskit
- pylatexenc

And optional for IBM quantum cloud computers:
- qiskit_ibm_provider
